# SLSA Compliance and Supply Chain Security

## Overview

This document outlines the Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) compliance strategy for the SQL Synthesis Agentic Playground, ensuring secure software supply chain practices.

## SLSA Framework Alignment

### Current SLSA Level: Level 1 (Documented)
**Target SLSA Level: Level 3 (Advanced)**

### SLSA Requirements Implementation

#### Build Level 1: Basic
- ✅ **Scripted Build**: Automated build process via Docker and Python packaging
- ✅ **Build Service**: GitHub Actions workflows (when implemented)
- ✅ **Provenance Generation**: Build metadata and attestations

#### Build Level 2: Hosted
- 🔄 **Hosted Build Service**: GitHub Actions with attestation generation
- 🔄 **Source Integrity**: Git-based source control with signed commits
- 🔄 **Parameterless**: Builds without external parameters

#### Build Level 3: Hardened
- 📋 **Hardened Build Platform**: Secure runner environments
- 📋 **Provenance Authenticated**: Cryptographically signed provenance
- 📋 **Non-falsifiable**: Tamper-resistant build records

## Supply Chain Security Controls

### Source Code Security

#### Version Control Security
```yaml
# Required Git Configuration
git_security:
  signed_commits: required
  branch_protection:
    main:
      required_reviews: 2
      dismiss_stale_reviews: true
      require_code_owner_reviews: true
      required_status_checks: true
      enforce_admins: true
  merge_restrictions:
    squash_merge: preferred
    merge_commit: disabled
    rebase_merge: allowed
```

#### Dependency Management
- **Automated Scanning**: Dependabot for vulnerability detection
- **License Compliance**: MIT-compatible licenses only
- **Pin Dependencies**: Lock file management for reproducible builds
- **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials creation

### Build Security

#### Secure Build Environment
```dockerfile
# Security-hardened build container
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder

# Security: Run as non-root user
RUN groupadd -r appuser && useradd -r -g appuser appuser
USER appuser

# Security: Read-only root filesystem
# Security: No network access during build (offline mode)
# Security: Minimal attack surface
```

#### Build Attestation
```yaml
# Build provenance attestation structure
attestation:
  predicate_type: https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2
  predicate:
    builder:
      id: https://github.com/actions/runner
    build_type: https://github.com/actions/workflow
    invocation:
      config_source:
        uri: git+https://github.com/user/repo@refs/heads/main
        digest: {"sha1": "commit_hash"}
    metadata:
      build_invocation_id: uuid
      completeness:
        parameters: true
        environment: true
        materials: true
    materials:
      - uri: git+https://github.com/user/repo
        digest: {"sha1": "commit_hash"}
```

### Artifact Security

#### Container Security
```yaml
# Container security configuration
container_security:
  base_images:
    - source: python:3.11-slim
      verification: sha256_digest
      vulnerability_scan: required
  security_contexts:
    run_as_non_root: true
    read_only_root_filesystem: true
    allow_privilege_escalation: false
    capabilities:
      drop: ["ALL"]
  network_policies:
    ingress: restricted
    egress: restricted
```

#### Package Security
```python
# Package integrity verification
package_verification = {
    "hash_algorithms": ["sha256", "sha384"],
    "signature_verification": "required",
    "provenance_attestation": "required",
    "vulnerability_scanning": "continuous"
}
```

## Compliance Verification

### Automated Checks
```bash
# SLSA compliance verification script
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "🔍 SLSA Compliance Verification"

# Check 1: Source integrity
echo "✓ Verifying source integrity..."
git verify-commit HEAD || echo "⚠️  Commit signature verification failed"

# Check 2: Build reproducibility
echo "✓ Testing build reproducibility..."
docker build --reproducible -t app:test .

# Check 3: Dependency verification
echo "✓ Verifying dependencies..."
pip-audit --requirement requirements.txt

# Check 4: Container security
echo "✓ Scanning container security..."
docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  aquasec/trivy image app:test

# Check 5: SBOM generation
echo "✓ Generating SBOM..."
syft packages dir:. -o spdx-json > sbom.spdx.json

echo "🎉 SLSA compliance verification complete"
```

### Manual Verification Checklist
- [ ] Build process is fully automated
- [ ] Source code is version controlled with integrity checks
- [ ] Dependencies are pinned and verified
- [ ] Build environment is isolated and reproducible
- [ ] Artifacts are signed and attested
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning is integrated
- [ ] Access controls are properly configured
- [ ] Audit trails are complete and tamper-resistant

## Threat Model

### Supply Chain Threats
1. **Source Code Tampering**: Malicious code injection
   - **Mitigation**: Signed commits, branch protection, code review
2. **Dependency Confusion**: Malicious package substitution
   - **Mitigation**: Package pinning, hash verification, private registry
3. **Build System Compromise**: Malicious build modification
   - **Mitigation**: Isolated builds, attestation, hardened runners
4. **Artifact Tampering**: Post-build modification
   - **Mitigation**: Signing, integrity checks, secure storage

### Risk Assessment Matrix
| Threat | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Mitigation Status |
|--------|------------|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Malicious Dependencies | Medium | High | High | ✅ Implemented |
| Build System Compromise | Low | High | Medium | 🔄 In Progress |
| Source Code Tampering | Low | High | Medium | 🔄 In Progress |
| Artifact Tampering | Low | Medium | Low | 📋 Planned |
