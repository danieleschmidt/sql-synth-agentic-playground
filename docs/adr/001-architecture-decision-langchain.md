# ADR-001: Use LangChain for SQL Generation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to implement a natural language to SQL translation system. Several approaches are available:
- Custom neural network implementation
- OpenAI API direct integration
- LangChain SQL Agent Toolkit
- Traditional rule-based parsing

## Decision
We will use LangChain SQL Agent Toolkit as our primary framework for natural language to SQL translation.

## Rationale

### Advantages of LangChain
1. **Proven Framework**: Established ecosystem with SQL-specific tools
2. **Security Built-in**: Parameterized query generation by default
3. **Multi-dialect Support**: Built-in support for various SQL dialects
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to customize and extend for specific needs
5. **Community Support**: Active development and community
6. **Integration Ready**: Works well with various LLM providers

### Specific Benefits
- **SQL Agent Toolkit**: Purpose-built for SQL generation tasks
- **Database Introspection**: Automatic schema understanding
- **Query Validation**: Built-in query validation and error handling
- **Dialect Awareness**: Automatic dialect-specific query generation

## Consequences

### Positive
- Faster development time due to pre-built components
- Better security through established patterns
- Easier maintenance with community support
- Built-in best practices for SQL generation

### Negative
- Dependency on external framework
- Learning curve for LangChain-specific patterns
- Potential version compatibility issues
- Less control over low-level implementation details

### Neutral
- Need to stay updated with LangChain releases
- Framework-specific documentation and debugging

## Implementation Notes
- Use `langchain_community.agent_toolkits.sql.base.create_sql_agent`
- Implement custom prompts for domain-specific requirements
- Configure database connections through SQLAlchemy
- Add custom validation layers for additional security

## Alternatives Considered

### Custom Implementation
- **Pros**: Full control, no external dependencies
- **Cons**: High development time, security risks, maintenance burden

### Direct OpenAI API
- **Pros**: Direct access to latest models
- **Cons**: No SQL-specific optimizations, security concerns, vendor lock-in

### Traditional Parsing
- **Pros**: Predictable, fast
- **Cons**: Limited natural language understanding, rigid patterns
