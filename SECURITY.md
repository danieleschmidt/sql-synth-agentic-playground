# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The SQL Synth Agentic Playground team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing [security@terragonlabs.com](mailto:security@terragonlabs.com).

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Include in Your Report

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g. SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities in the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Security Features

### SQL Injection Prevention

Our primary security focus is preventing SQL injection attacks, which is critical for a system that generates SQL queries from natural language input.

**Security Measures:**
- **Parameterized Queries**: All SQL queries use parameterized statements with bound parameters
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation and sanitization of all user inputs
- **Query Analysis**: Static analysis of generated queries before execution
- **Execution Sandboxing**: Limited database permissions and connection isolation

### Authentication and Authorization

**Current Implementation:**
- Environment-based configuration for database credentials
- Secure credential management through environment variables
- No hardcoded passwords or API keys in source code

**Planned Enhancements:**
- OAuth 2.0 integration for user authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API key management for programmatic access
- Session management and token-based authentication

### Data Protection

**Encryption:**
- Data in transit: HTTPS/TLS for all web communications
- Database connections: Encrypted database connections (SSL/TLS)
- Environment variables: Secure handling of sensitive configuration

**Data Handling:**
- No permanent storage of user queries by default
- Anonymized logging (no sensitive data in logs)
- Configurable data retention policies

### Infrastructure Security

**Container Security:**
- Non-root user execution in Docker containers
- Minimal base images to reduce attack surface
- Regular security scanning with Trivy and Snyk
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

**Network Security:**
- Network isolation using Docker networks
- Reverse proxy configuration with Nginx
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Scanning

We implement multiple layers of automated security testing:

1. **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**
   - Bandit: Python security linting
   - Semgrep: Multi-language static analysis
   - CodeQL: GitHub's semantic analysis

2. **Dependency Scanning**
   - pip-audit: Python package vulnerability scanning
   - Safety: Python dependency security checking
   - Snyk: Comprehensive dependency analysis

3. **Container Security**
   - Trivy: Container image vulnerability scanning
   - Docker security scanning
   - Base image security updates

4. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - Checkov: Terraform and Docker configuration security
   - Security policy validation

### Manual Security Testing

Regular security assessments include:

- Penetration testing of SQL injection vectors
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Input validation testing
- Session management testing
- Error handling security review

## Security Compliance

### Standards and Frameworks

We align with industry security standards:

- **OWASP Top 10**: Address all critical web application security risks
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Implement comprehensive security controls
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management principles
- **SOC 2**: Security, availability, and confidentiality controls

### Compliance Features

- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all security-relevant events
- **Access Controls**: Principle of least privilege implementation
- **Data Governance**: Clear data handling and retention policies
- **Incident Response**: Documented security incident procedures
