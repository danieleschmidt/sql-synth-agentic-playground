# GitHub Actions Setup Required

## Overview

This repository has comprehensive SDLC documentation but is missing the actual GitHub Actions workflow implementations. The following workflows need to be created in `.github/workflows/`:

## Required Workflow Files

### 1. `ci.yml` - Main CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install -e ".[dev]"
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest --cov=src --cov-report=xml
    
    - name: Upload coverage
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
      with:
        file: ./coverage.xml

  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Run security scan
      run: python scripts/security_scan.py

  performance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Run performance benchmarks
      run: python scripts/performance_profiler.py
```

### 2. `security.yml` - Security Scanning
```yaml
name: Security Scan

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1'  # Weekly Monday 2 AM

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
      uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
      with:
        scan-type: 'fs'
        scan-ref: '.'
        format: 'sarif'
        output: 'trivy-results.sarif'
    
    - name: Upload Trivy scan results
      uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
      with:
        sarif_file: 'trivy-results.sarif'
```

### 3. `release.yml` - Automated Releases
```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*']

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Generate changelog
      run: python scripts/generate_changelog.py
    
    - name: Create release
      uses: actions/create-release@v1
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
        release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
        body_path: CHANGELOG.md
        draft: false
        prerelease: false
```

## Repository Settings Required

### Branch Protection Rules
- Enable branch protection for `main` branch
- Require pull request reviews (minimum 1)
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Include administrators in restrictions

### Security Features
- Enable vulnerability alerts
- Enable automated security fixes
- Enable dependency graph
- Enable secret scanning
- Enable code scanning with CodeQL

### Webhook Configuration
- Configure webhooks for external monitoring systems
- Set up notification channels for security alerts
- Configure deployment webhooks

## Environment Variables and Secrets

Set up the following secrets in repository settings:

```bash
# Required for CI/CD
CODECOV_TOKEN=<codecov_token>

# Optional for enhanced features
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=<slack_webhook_for_notifications>
DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME=<dockerhub_username>
DOCKER_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<dockerhub_token>
```

## Manual Implementation Steps

1. **Create workflow files**: Copy the YAML content above into respective files in `.github/workflows/`
2. **Configure repository settings**: Enable security features and branch protection
3. **Set up secrets**: Add required environment variables and tokens
4. **Test workflows**: Create a test PR to verify all workflows execute correctly
5. **Monitor results**: Ensure security scans, tests, and performance benchmarks pass

## Integration with Existing Tools

These workflows integrate with:
- Pre-commit hooks (already configured)
- Security scanning scripts (already implemented)
- Performance profiling tools (already available)
- Dependency management (Dependabot already configured)

## Expected Benefits

After implementation:
- Automated testing on all Python versions
- Continuous security scanning
- Automated changelog generation
- Performance regression detection
- Compliance with SLSA security framework

**Note**: As an AI assistant, I cannot directly create GitHub Actions workflow files due to security restrictions. Please implement these workflows manually following the templates above.
