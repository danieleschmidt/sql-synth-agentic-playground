# Project Charter: SQL Synthesis Agentic Playground

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: SQL Synthesis Agentic Playground  
**Project Code**: SSAP  
**Start Date**: Q1 2025  
**Target Completion**: Q3 2025  
**Project Manager**: Development Team  
**Stakeholders**: Data Engineers, Analysts, Developers  

## Problem Statement

Organizations struggle with the complexity of SQL query generation, leading to:
- **Time Inefficiency**: Manual SQL writing consumes 30-40% of analyst time
- **Skill Barriers**: Non-technical users cannot access database insights
- **Error Propensity**: Manual SQL coding introduces syntax and logic errors
- **Dialect Confusion**: Multiple database systems require different SQL dialects

## Project Purpose and Justification

### Business Need
- Enable natural language to SQL translation for democratized data access
- Reduce time-to-insight for business analysts and data scientists
- Minimize SQL injection vulnerabilities through automated parameterization
- Provide standardized evaluation against industry benchmarks (Spider, WikiSQL)

### Strategic Alignment
- **Data Democracy**: Aligns with organizational goal of self-service analytics
- **Security First**: Implements zero-trust SQL generation principles
- **Performance Excellence**: Targets sub-2-second query generation
- **Quality Assurance**: Establishes measurable accuracy benchmarks
